	<h1>Welcome to J Query Learning Webpage.</h1>
	<img src="images/jq.png" width="700px"/>
	<br/><hr/>


	<p>To get the features of J Query there are two methods <br/><br/> In first Method We need to download the JS file from "jquery.com" inorder to get library file. (in this case the file will be offline) <br/><br/> In Second Method we use Content Delivery Network (CDN) where we will not be downloading any file but if we want to access this we need to connect to internet.</p>
	<p>The process for Method 2 Content Delivery Network (CDN) is <br/> first Go to jquery.com website and then Under "Download jQuery" section in website scroll down then we can see "Using jQuery with a CDN" and under that(in 3rd para) we can observe there is a hyperlink "https://code.jquery.com" and after clicking we can see all the CDN's available and from then we can select uncompressed one then we can get the code part and we can directly paste the code from that website to our code.</p>

	<br/><hr/>


	<h2>The below text will become faded once you click "Click Me" button.</h2>
	<p>Fading has been done using J Query Library which simples the writing of code, where we can write the entire code in 1 Line.<br/> In this case we have used fadeToggle() method.<br/> if we want to apply our J Query to only one particular line we assign "id" to that particular line and in that case we use "#" like "#heading1"  <br/> if we want to apply our J Query to more than one line when we assign class to all the required lines and in that case we use dot(.) like ".heading"</p>

	<p>e.g-1)The below is an example of Fade-in and Fade-out using J Query. <br/> Syntax is $("#heading1").fadeToggle(2000);</p>
	<h2 id="heading1">Fading content using fadeToggle().</h2>
	<button id="btn1" onclick="fn1()">Click Me</button>


	<br/><hr/>

	<h2>now let us know about J Query Selectors.</h2>
	<p>jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).<br/><br/>jQuery selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes and much more. It's based on the existing CSS Selectors, and in addition, it has some own custom selectors.</p>

	<p>e.g-2)The below is an example of Fade-in, Fade-out but in this case we have used Selectors(means we have assigned class to three h2 tags and applied fade-in and fade-out animations on them). and we have assigned the class to lines 1, 3, 4.<br/> Syntax is $(".heading2").fadeToggle(2000);</p>

	<h2 class="heading2">This is heading tag [line-1].</h2>
	<h2>This is heading tag [line-2].</h2>
	<h2 class="heading2">This is heading tag [line-3].</h2>
	<p class="heading2">This is p tag [line-4].</p>

	<button id="btn2" onclick="fn2()">Click Me</button>

	<br/><hr/>

	<h2>now let us know further about selectors.</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>$("#first,#second").action()</dt>
		<dd>if we want to apply our animation for more than one "id" we make use of above syntax.</dd>
		<dt>$("#first,p").action()</dt>
		<dd>if we want to apply our animation for multiple things i.e; first one in which we assigned id as "first" and second one with all the paragraphs we make use of above syntax. [in case we want to add to more we can add using the same syntax]</dd>
		<dt>$("div > p").action() or $("div p").action()</dt>
		<dd>if we want to apply our animation to all the paragraphs which are in div tag we can use anyone from the above syntax [in the above example we can use them for any others also like which are in parent tag an child tag]</dd>
		<dt>$("p:first").action()</dt>
		<dd>if we want to apply our animation to the "first" paragraph only then we can make use of above syntax. [p can be changes to any other tag].</dd>
		<dt>$("p:even").action()</dt>
		<dd>if we want to apply our animation to the "even" paragraphs only then we can make use of above syntax. [p can be changes to any other tag like div tags, heading tags... etc;].</dd>
		<dt>$("p:odd").action()</dt>
		<dd>if we want to apply our animation to the "odd" paragraphs only then we can make use of above syntax. [p can be changes to any other tag like div tags, heading tags... etc;].</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>e.g-3) in the below example we are going to fade paragraphs in first division and even ones in list items.</p>
	<h2>This is a heading.</h2>
	<div id="firstdiv" class="mydivs">
		<p>This is first paragraph in first division.</p>
		<p>This is second paragraph in first division.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="seconddiv" class="mydivs">
		<p>This is third paragraph in second division.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="thirddiv" class="mydivs"> 
		<ul>
			<li>List item 1.</li>
			<li>List item 2.</li>
			<li>List item 3.</li>
			<li>List item 4.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<button id="btn3">Click me</button>

	<br/><hr/>


	<h2>now let us know about more events.</h2>
	<p>From the below image we can understand two things.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>we no need to use "onclick" method instead we can use <b>$("id_of_button").click(function_name)</b> in JS which directly calls the function. or we can also use <b>$("id_of_button").click(function(){-----we can write our function here------});</b>  </li>
		<li>if we want our buttons to work only when our browser loads completely then we can use <b>$(document).ready(function(){-----we can write our function here------});</b> [ to understand better if we observe below image we can see that button function is written inside this, now if only the page loads completely the button works otherwise the button will not work.</li>
	</ol>

	<img src="images/events.png"/ width="500px">

	<br/><hr/>

	<h2>Now let us know about "dblclick" which means our button will only work when we press the button two times.</h2>

  	<p>e.g-4) In the below example we are going to fade paragraphs in the second division and heading, but the button only works when it is double-clicked.</p>

  	<h2 id="o1">This is a heading.</h2>

  	<div id="firstdiv" class="mydivs1">
    	<p>This is the first paragraph in the first division.</p>
    	<p>This is the second paragraph in the first division.</p>
  	</div>

  	<div id="seconddiv1" class="mydivs1">
	    <p>This is the third paragraph in the second division.</p>
  	</div>

  	<button id="btn4">Click me twice</button>

  	<br/><hr/>


  	<h2>mouseenter and mouseleave which is equal to onmouseover and onmouseout [we can use hover also instead of mouseenter and mouseleave]</h2>

  	<p>in J Query we will be using mouseenter and mouseleave instead of onmouseover and onmouseout <br/> and even without using mouseenter and mouseleave we can use hover and directly pass the two functions in hover method</p>

  	<p>e.g-5) In the below example we are going to fade paragraphs in the second division and third division but <br/> Click me 1 is done using mouseenter and mouseleave <br/> Click me 2 is done using hover</p>


  	<button id="btn5">Click me 1</button>
  	<button id="btn6">Click me 2</button>

  	<h2 id="o3">This is a heading.</h2>

  	<div id="firstdiv3" class="mydivs3">
    	<p>This is the first paragraph in the first division.</p>
    	<p>This is the second paragraph in the first division.</p>
  	</div>

  	<div id="seconddiv3" class="mydivs3">
	    <p>This is the third paragraph in the second division.</p>
  	</div>
